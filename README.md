# VL.VirusTotal

A little node set to make requests to the [VirusTotal V3 REST API](https://docs.virustotal.com/docs/api-overview).

> [!NOTE]  
> Currently, this library will only support a (very) limited subset of the VirusTotal V3 API, as I am wrapping it for a personal project.
> There are no plans for a complete implementation, but feel free to reach out if you need a more comprehensive version.

## Supported features

- Returns _Last Analysis Stats_ and _Suggested Threat Label_ for a file hash
